# Unity Snake Game
This is a simple snake game built using Unity. The goal of the game is to control the snake and eat as many apples as possible without crashing into the walls or the snake's own body.

# Installation
To play the game, access it on my [Itch.io page](https://lucas-efeito.itch.io/snake-game)

# How to Play
Use the WASD keys to control the direction of the snake. The snake will move automatically, so you need to be quick to avoid crashing into the walls or the snake's own body. Each time the snake eats an apple, it will grow longer.
